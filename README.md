# 2022-FIFA-World-Cup-Simulator
I built a 2022 FIFA World Cup simulator using Python. The program simulates every single match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, from the group stage all the way to the final. For every match, the program outputs match results, possession statistics, and goals scored by each team. The outputs for matches played in each group will be displayed under a label for each respective group, with a table displaying the group standings at the bottom. The table will display the number of games won, number of games lost, number of draws, number of goals for, number of goals against, overall goal difference, and number of points for each team in the group. The first and second placed teams in each group will then move on to the knockout rounds, which will run their course until the final match. The program will simulate penalty shootouts for matches that end in a draw during the knockout rounds, displaying every penalty that was taken by both teams and the order in which they were scored/missed. Penalties that are scored are denoted by an "O" in the sequence while penalties that are missed will be denoted as an "x" in the sequence.
